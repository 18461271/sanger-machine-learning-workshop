    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Unsupervised learning* refers to machine learning techniques where we do not give the learning algorithm a target output (e.g. a set of expected classifications of the data). Instead, the algorithm must interpret the data entirely on its own, without any supervision from the user. Unsupervised learning is useful when we don't have access to pre-labelled data (e.g. this set of measurements corresponds to a faulty unit, and this other set of measurements corresponds to a funcitoning unit), or when we're more interested in exploring what trends exist in data (including those we may not even know about). However, the distinctions drawn in unsupervised learning tend to be less clear-cut than in supervised learning, and often involve more subjectivity in choice of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of unsupervised learning in the context of systems administration include:\n",
    "* Automated detection of abnormal events in logs\n",
    "* Automated detection of anomalies time series data\n",
    " * e.g. a spike in write latency on a NetApp that might indicate an errant job\n",
    "* Learned models of a system, which can then be used for prediction\n",
    " * e.g. a learned model of PUE from machine load, outside air temperature etc. that can then be used to investigate the effect of making a change to one of the variable (see Google's [Better data centers through machine learning](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/better-data-centers-through-machine.html))"

    "## Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we'll be focusing on a simple example of time series anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is based on Chapter 4, *More Complex, Adaptive Models* from [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-machine-learning/9781491914151/ch04.html) by Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we may be able to detect anomalies simply by looking for any values beyond a certain threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/simple_anomaly.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 45%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, though, the structure of the waveform may prevent detection using this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/harder_anomaly.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 45%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "And more subtle errors - a change in the shape of a periodic waveform, for examples - will be simply impossible to pick up with such a method:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/really_hard_anomaly.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 45%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want is a more method that can learn what constitutes a \"normal\" waveform, not just in terms of its instantaneous value, but in terms of its *shape*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will be to define an \"anomaly\" as being some pattern in the waveform that hasn't been seen before. Our algorithm will build up a library of \"normal\" waveform shapes, and use that library to try and reconstruct a waveform to be tested. If the reconstruction is poor, then the waveform is likely to contain something abnormal, and is therefore anomalous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore how we might go about determining what counts as normal, let's take a step back from our problem and have a look at a simpler example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we're manufacturing power supplies. Our power supplies use capacitors from two different manufacturers. During the QA phase we measure two variables for each unit tested: power efficiency and voltage ripple. We could plot a graph of one variable against another to get a sense of the distribution of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/clusters.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 45%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "These two variables have acceptance tolerances, as shown by the dotted lines. Within these limits, however, we find that the data tends to form two groups, or *clusters*, depending on which type of capacitor is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the next power supply that comes off the assembly line meets the tolerance requirements, but falls a way outside either of the two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/clusters_anomaly.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 45%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sign that there might be something wrong with the unit; that it is in some way anomalous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our clusters existed in the two-dimensional space defined by two variables (or two *features*, in machine learning parlance). But we can easily visualise how the approach can generalise to a three-dimensional space, defined by three features - or even an *n*-dimensional space, defined by *n* features. (The general case is a little harder to visualise, so just imagine a three-dimensional space and pretend there are more dimensions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters can be identified programatically using a *clustering* algorithm. The particular method we'll be using is called *k-means clustering*. (See [Cluster - K-means algorithm](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/78) on Coursera if you're interested in more details of how the k-means algorithm works.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Waveform Space\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply such a technique to waveforms, we'll need to decide how we're going to define the space in which clusters will be formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll need to split the waveform into segments to give us separate \"samples\". But what will our *features* be - what are the variables that will define the *n*-dimensional space? We could go with standard measurements of each segment such as maximum, minimum and spread. But since our technique is generalisable to any number of dimensions, we can do something a bit more clever: we can take each element of the segment as a separate dimension. For a segment containing 32 time values, we define a 32-dimensional space. It is in this 32-dimensional space that we will form our clusters of waveform segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Waveform Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of the power supplies, we detected anomalous samples based on the distance from clusters. For our waveforms, we're going to take a slightly different approach so that we can visualise what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our 32-dimensional waveform space. Each point in this space represents a possible waveform segment. Similar segments will cluster together. The middle of each cluster (the *centroid*) will provide some measure of the prototypical waveform pattern that all those segments are specific instances of. (If this is difficult to visualise, the other way to consider it is that the centroid is simply an average of all waveform samples in that cluster.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the centroid, being a point in the waveform space, is itself a waveform. Thus, the cluster centroids provide us with a set of \"normal\" waveform segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we then try to use our set of \"normal\" segments to reconstruct a set of data to be tested. If the data is similar in shape to what has come before it, we will be able to manage a good reconstruction. However, if the data contains some abnormal shape, we will not be able to reconstruct it using our normal shape library, and we will get a reconstruction error. This error will indicate an anomaly!\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our algorithm will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split waveform data into segments of *n* samples\n",
    "* Form a space in *n* dimensions, with each segment representing one point\n",
    "* Determine clustering of segment points, and determine the centres or *centroids* of the clusters\n",
    "* Cluster centroids provide library of \"normal\" waveform shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to reconstruct waveform data to be tested using cluster centroids learned during training\n",
    "* Poor reconstruction error on any individual segment indicates anomalous shape"

This gives a large, easily visible reconstruction error! This error could be easily detected using a simple threshold detector."

For example, we could have trained a predictive neural network model, and examined the difference between the predicted waveform and the actual waveform. In general, there is no 'one size fits all' solution in machine learning - different techniques will be required for different problems.\n",
